# Altimeter Practice

Most flight instruments are simple to read, but three-hand altimeters take a
bit more experience. I wrote this simple quiz to practice reading them.

You can download the files for offline use (no server needed), or go to [the
hosted version](https://kj7rrv.com/altimeter-practice), which is simply a Web
site that requires no download or installation.
